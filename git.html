      Programming is an intricate discipline. There are many moving parts that must coexist and collaborate within a piece of software. As you can imagine if a comma is out of place or if a function is spitting out the wrong stuff, the entire machine, the entire piece of software will shit the bed. It is well known that programming demands careful precision and constant attention to detail. But how do developers manage this precision across a large project? When there are 10, 50, 100 programmers working on a single piece of software how do you ensure that every little piece of the puzzle is properly constructed, tested and integrated. Well the answer was developed in the early 90's with the concept of a Version Control System that was developed and widely used in an enterprise setting. Shortly after a man named Linus Torvalds, the father of Linux, built a free open source tool called Git that would soon be adopted as the version control standard for software development.

       So what is version control? What is Git? Well version control does exactly what it sounds like, it controls versions. If you have ever collaborated on a word doc with someone you may see how having multiple people collaborating can get messy and cluttered. Worse than that the possibility of serious setbacks can arise. Someone deleted the entire doc, someone uploaded a cat picture that won't delete, someone lost the final version, who controls the final version anyways? It's a huge pain in the ass. But with version control it's easy.     </p>

        When using git you basically have your own little sandbox to play in. You take a copy of the final project whatever it is, a powerpoint, some code, docx, whatever you want. You can then edit this file to your liking. But all the while none of your changes are affecting the "master" file, they are only affecting your local copy in your little sandbox. When you are ready however you can commit the edits you have made to the "master" file. But git will always have a copy of every version that the project goes through. So maybe a week down the line you realize your whole project is screwed because of some fatal error or some ugly picture of a cat you can type in a command and poof your back to where you were before.

        However Git is a local thing. All your stuff is stored on your computer in its memory. If you want to reach an all new level of l33t and manage a project on the internet or the cloud as we like to say this is possible with GitHub! With this all the versioning and file editing that you are doing with git can be used by others. You can have millions of people all collaborating making changes accepting changes and creating some badass software.
