	<h3>Array vs Hash</h3>
	
	<p class="blog">
An array is an object in Ruby that stores other objects assigns them an index value and keeps them in the same place. An array most closely resembles a list in other languages such as Python. Arrays can store many different types of objects such as strings, integers, floats, and even other arrays. Ruby has many built in methods for arrays that make manipulating them much easier. Methods such as .each and .map will iterate through the array and generate a block for you to execute looped code. There are many other methods that are very useful.<br><br>



Creating an Array can happen in many different ways. You can either create it empty, specify how many spaces it should have (still empty), or even fill it with default values.vAccessing items is super easy, just start from an index value of 0 like you do with strings. Just like with strings, you can start from the end of the array using negative index numbers from -1 and you can even grab ranges of values at a time.<br><br>

Hashes may be a bit intimidating at first but they're actually pretty similar to arrays. They're basically just containers for data, like arrays, but instead of storing data based on numeric indices, you use "keys" which can be strings or symbols. This makes hashes more appropriate for storing data with a bit more depth to it. A Hash is just a container for data where each piece of data is mapped to a Key. The data is called the Value. Keys can be either strings or symbols. Values can be anything, just like with arrays. A hash looks almost like an array, but with squiggly braces {} instead of hard ones [] There's no order to a hash (unlike an array)... you're accessing your data using strings anyway so it doesn't matter which order they're in.<br><br>

You store data in a hash by matching a key with a value. Use the Hash Rocket => (not to be confused with the same symbol in our IRB examples which denotes the IRB output) if you're creating the hash, or just index into it like an array using hard brackets []. You can change data in a hash just like an array, by indexing into it and assigning a new value. Unlike an array, to create a new data item, just pretend it already exists and assign it a value.</p>
