	<h3>Chunk Method</h3>
	
	<p class="blog">
The enumerable method I chose is called chunk. Chunk is a method in the enumerator class of ruby. You can call chunk on any object that is an enumerable. When you call chunk on an array, you can pass in a block. If you pass in a block any time that block is true it chunk will return a new array for each element of the block that is true. As soon as chunk come across an element in the array that returns false when put theough the block, it will return a new array with elements that are false consecutively until it come across a true element. It will continue to iterate through returning differen't arrays for elements that are false and elements that are true until it iterates through the entire array.br><br>
