I actually had a dream about this exact topic last night for some reason. Maybe it's because I was up until 3am building classes but that's just a shot in the dark. Instead of going into the boring details I am going to go on a complete tangent unrelated to the intricacies of ruby classes but important to the understanding of what a class is. <br><br>



When you think in your mind of a tiger what happens? A fuzzy picture of a large cat with beautiful markings and colors pops up into your mind, ferocious yet elegant. But you are most likely not thinking of an individual tiger you have met right? Your mind is kind of guessing what a tiger is based upon what you know of a tiger. Your mind isn't actually pulling up a snapshot of a real tiger. I like to call this "tiger-ness" the essence of being a tiger. I know what the essence of a tiger is, large cat, beautiful colors, carnivorous hunter, etc. 
<br><br>

This tiger-ness or essence of being is something that is echoed in the world of object-orientation. So lets take our tiger and chuck him into the Object Oriented world (poor bastard). Our class would be the essence of the tiger. "Tiger-ness" the fundamental things that make you a tiger vs. a jar of peanut butter or a slug. So I plop all these things into my class. Boom I have a blueprint for a tiger, I have nailed the essence of being a tiger, tiger-ness. <br><br>

But what if I want to make a real tiger named jimmy who lives in Kathmandu. I only have the essence of tiger the archetype of tiger, I have no real breathing living tiger. But now that we have made our class of tiger it's super easy to make a real tiger. We just need to give this tiger some of his individual characteristics. The attributes that make him a real individual tiger not just the abstract concept of tiger-ness. So I give him a name, I give him a few spots on his face, he burnt off a few whiskers last week, and he lives in Kathmandu. Boom those are his individual characteristics. Everything else is inherited from his class the tiger-ness class. His shape his movement his behavior patterns were all laid out in tiger-ness class, but his individual characteristics, his whiskers and spots and name they are all unique to him and they are what make him Jimmy!</p>
