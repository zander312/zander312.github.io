	<h3>NoSQL</h3>
	
	<p class="blog">
Relational databases as we have seen this week are structured in a column/row excel style fashion. They are fast and good at structuring simple data to provide complex business logic. They have also been around for many years and there is a lot of infrastructure supporting them. However, recently a new class of database has emerged that provides much more flexibility and scalability and is slowly gaining popularity in the tech world. This database is a NoSQL database.  <br><br>



There are different "structures" of NoSQL databases that suit different forms of business logic. The main four are Document, Graphs Store, Key-value Store and Wide-column Store. Each uses a different architecture for storing data. NoSQL databases are more scalable and provide superior performance. They are also easily distributed with means that you can store little bits of data on different machines all over the place ("in the cloud" so to speak) Whereas Relational databases are traditionally large servers located in one place and maintained in one place (although Oracle has new cloud SQL products so that is not entirely true).  
<br><br>

NoSQL databases are built to allow the insertion of data without a predefined schema. That makes it easy to make significant application changes in real-time, without worrying about service interruptions â€“ which means development is faster, code integration is more reliable, and less database administrator time is needed.  <br><br>
