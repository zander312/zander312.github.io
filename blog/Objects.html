	<h3>Ruby Hash vs. Javascript Objects</h3>
	
	<p class="blog">
Hashes and objects are very similar data structures. They even look alike.<br>
jim = { name: "Jim", age: 25, shoe_size: 9 }<br>
var Jim = { name: "Jim", age: 25, shoe_size: 9 };<br>
But there is one distinct difference between a ruby hash and a javascript object. Javascript objects can take a function as a value. Since methods in Ruby aren't objects, you can't assign a method as a hash value. This is a handy bit of functionality possessed by JavaScript objects, with no direct equivalent for Ruby hashes. If you wanted to achieve something similar in Ruby you would need to use classes.<br>
